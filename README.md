## Type Annotations

TypeScript introduces type annotations to JavaScript, allowing you to specify the types of variables, function parameters, and return values. This helps catch errors early and improves code readability.

## Interfaces and Types

Interfaces and type aliases are used to define the shape of objects and enforce structure. They are essential for creating complex types and ensuring consistency across your codebase.

## Unions and Intersections

Union types allow a variable to hold more than one type, while intersection types combine multiple types into one.

## Enums

Enums provide a way to define named constants, making it easier to work with sets of related values.

## Generics

Generics enable you to create reusable components that work with a variety of types. They are particularly useful for functions, classes, and interfaces.

## Read-only Variables

Read-only variables ensure that once a value is assigned to a variable, it cannot be changed. This is useful for maintaining the integrity of data that should not be modified after initialization.
